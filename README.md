   Distributed Microservices Home Suite
   [ Python | Go | Java | Angular | K8s ]

# Trencadís: A Clean Architecture Microservices Suite

**Trencadís** is a home management ecosystem built to demonstrate modern software engineering practices. Inspired by the mosaic technique of **Catalan Modernism**, this project assembles diverse technologies (Python, Go, Java, Angular) into a cohesive, scalable, and robust distributed system.

## 🏛 Architecture Overview
This project follows the **Clean Architecture** principles by Robert C. Martin. Each service is designed with a strict separation of concerns, ensuring the business logic remains independent of frameworks and external agencies.

- **Frontend:** Angular 17+ (Reactive State Management)
- **Recipe Service:** Python & FastAPI (High-performance API)
- **Shopping List Service:** Go (Concurrent & Lightweight)
- **Spending Service:** Java & Spring Boot (Enterprise-grade robustness)
- **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes (Orchestration) & GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## 🛠 Project Roadmap
- [ ] **Phase 0: Create repository and project structure** - Current
- [ ] **Phase 1: Recipe Service (Python)** - Upcoming
- [ ] **Phase 2: Shopping List (Go)** - Upcoming
- [ ] **Phase 3: Financial Module (Java)** - Planned
- [ ] **Phase 4: Dashboard (Angular)** - Planned
- [ ] **Phase 5: Cloud Native Deployment (K8s)** - Planned

## 👨‍💻 Engineering Standards
- **Clean Code:** Self-documenting code, SRP, and meaningful naming.

- **SOLID Principles:** Strictly followed across all languages.

- **Testing:** Unit and Integration tests for every business use case.

- **Documentation:** Architecture decision records (ADR) and C4 Diagrams.
